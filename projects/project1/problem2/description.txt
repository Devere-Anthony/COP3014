Problem 2 - Write a C++ program called numdigits.cpp that reads an integer number into your 
program and counts the number of digits in the number.
Example: 435 -> 3, 1992 -> 4

* TO DO: Find an algorithm for a function that can be used to output the number of digits in 
an integer input

1) read input into a string instead of an int 
2) iterate over string
3) each iteration increment a counter by 1
4) once loop is complete, output count
