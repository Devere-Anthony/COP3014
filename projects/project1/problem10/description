Exercise 10: Accpet and unspecified number of integers from the user (ask if user wants to enter another integer each time).
When the user finishes entering numbers, program displays the count of positive, negative, and zeroes entered.

Algorithm
* prompt user for input 
* read input into an integer type 
* test input 
	- if input > 0, increment positive count 
	- if input < 0, increment negative count 
	- if input == 0, increment 0 count 
	** What to do with bad input? **
* output count of each type
