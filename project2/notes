Classes and Files:
* header file - includes the class definition 
* .cpp - member function definition (i.e. only place function implementations in this cpp file 
	but keep the function declaractions and data memebers in the header file
* NOTE: be sure to include the class header file when one wants to use the class

Header file guards:
* #ifndef FILENAME_H
* #define FILENAME_H
	// header contents
* #endif

Unit Testing:
* testbench: a program to test another program 
* test case: series of input/outpout checks 
* Unit testing: creating a testbench with test cases to test a class/function 

Modular Compilation:
1) Compiling - files compiled separately into object files
2) linking - object files are linked together into an executable
