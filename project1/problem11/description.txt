Task: Write a C++ program to find the octal equivalent of the entered decimal number. 

Binary to Ocatal Algorithm:
---------------------------
1) Perform integer division by 8 on the input to get the quotient 
2) execute modulo division by 8 on the input to get the remainder 
3) store quotient as input 
4) store remainder as most significant digit in octal number
5) if quotient is equal to 0, then the MSD is equal to the input
   and the algorithm is complete 
6) repeat step 1 with new input
